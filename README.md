## Other fun projects  
>### [Fill in the blanks generator](https://github.com/sudheernaidu53/Machine-learning-Deep-learning-projects/tree/master/fill%20in%20the%20blanks%20using%20nltk)  
>> Using nltk library, we can create fill in the blanks type questions by randomly selecting proper noun or noun as the blank  
>### [Trapped Knight](https://github.com/sudheernaidu53/Machine-learning-Deep-learning-projects/tree/master/The%20trapped%20knight)  
>>Ever wondered what happens to different chess pieces if there is infinite/finite board and it is numbered it in someway, and you want to move your chess piece that it keeps moving to unseen squares and are numbered smallest possible, here I tried to implement this problem with knight and the pattern of numbers on chess board are increasing outwards spirally.  
>>Got the inspiration to write this from this [numberphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGQe8waGJ4w), and it's beautiful  
>>Find the images of the patterns the knight follow [here](https://github.com/sudheernaidu53/Machine-learning-Deep-learning-projects/tree/master/The%20trapped%20knight/images)  
here is how the names and titles of the images are given  
**length** : number after 'length_' is number of squares in a row or column of the chessboard  
**pattern** : two numbers seperated by space after 'pattern_' is the pattern which the knight is following while moving  
**infi/small board** : 'infi board' conveys that the knight is trapped because all possible moves have been visited where as 'small board' conveys that the knight is trapped because the board is small/constrained and could have moved even more if the board was big  
**struck at** : the number of the square where the knight is struck on the chessboard  
**after** : number of moves the knight made before getting trapped.  
Best thing, I felt so content when I saw the colorful patterns of knight for different patterns and different board sizes, a crucifix, a window, a windmill....I am attaching some images here for your pleasure.
