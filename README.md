## Other fun projects  
>### [Fill in the blanks generator](https://github.com/sudheernaidu53/Machine-learning-Deep-learning-projects/tree/master/fill%20in%20the%20blanks%20using%20nltk)  
>> Using nltk library, we can create fill in the blanks type questions by randomly selecting proper noun or noun as the blank  
>### [Trapped Knight](https://github.com/sudheernaidu53/Machine-learning-Deep-learning-projects/tree/master/fill%20in%20the%20blanks%20using%20nltk)  
>> found this [link](https://oeis.org/A316667/b316667.txt) which tells you where the knight gets trapped for different sizes of chess board
